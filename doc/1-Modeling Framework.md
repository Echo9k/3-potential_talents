### Phase 1: Modeling Framework

#### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

##### 1.1 Text-based Features

- The use of `fuzz.partial_ratio`, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT is solid. Here are some potential improvements:
  - **Hybrid Embeddings**: Combine multiple embeddings (e.g., GloVe + BERT or TF-IDF + Word2Vec) to capture both semantic and contextual nuances.
  - **Sentence Transformers (SBERT)**: Fine-tuned versions of BERT specifically designed for sentence similarity tasks could outperform traditional embeddings.
  - **Custom Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune a BERT model on domain-specific job titles or descriptions to increase relevance and improve similarity scoring.
  - **Ensemble Embedding Scoring**: Aggregate similarity scores across multiple embeddings using weighted averages, with weights determined by model validation.

##### 1.2 Connection Feature

- Scaling using `StandardScaler` is a good start for normalizing the data. For better feature representation:
  - Apply **log transformation** if the distribution is skewed (e.g., connections heavily concentrated at 500+).
  - Treat "500+" as a categorical level (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") and encode it into ordinal values before scaling.

##### 1.3 Location and Keywords

- Geographic embeddings with Word2Vec are a great idea, especially given the structured nature of location data.
  - To enhance it, preprocess the location field to standardize formats (e.g., converting "i̇zmir türkiye" to "Izmir, Turkey").
  - Consider clustering similar locations into regions (e.g., "North Carolina Area") to reduce sparsity in embeddings.
  - Use **POS tagging** to ensure proper recognition of city names during Word2Vec embedding creation.

##### 2. Model Selection and Current Results Review

The provided dataset is well-structured for initial modeling, but here are some observations and recommendations:

**Observations:**

- The dataset has **53 entries**, which is relatively small for training deep models but sufficient for initial prototyping or lightweight models like XGBoost.
- The features already include multiple similarity scores from various models, which provides a rich foundation for meta-modeling or ensemble approaches.
- `partial_match` as an integer feature appears to capture keyword overlap or some heuristic matching but needs better integration into the modeling pipeline.

**Recommendations for Model Selection:**

1. **Gradient Boosting Models**:
   - Use **XGBoost, LightGBM**, or **CatBoost** for combining the provided similarity scores into a single predictive model for `fit`. These models are robust with mixed feature types and work well on small datasets.
   - Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation is essential to avoid overfitting given the small dataset.

2. **Stacking Ensemble**:
   - Create a meta-model where the input features are predictions from individual models (TF-IDF, GloVe, etc.), along with engineered features like `connection` and `partial_match`. The meta-model could be a logistic regression or a lightweight gradient boosting model.

3. **Neural Network (Optional)**:
   - A simple feed-forward neural network with layers that can learn from both numerical (`connection`, `similarity_score`, etc.) and embedded text features (BERT embeddings).

4. **Evaluate Metrics**:
   - Use ranking-based metrics like **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** or **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)** to evaluate performance, as the primary goal is to rank candidates effectively.

**Handling the Dataset:**

- With only 53 entries, a **5-fold cross-validation** is recommended to maximize the use of the available data.
- Augment the dataset by creating synthetic variations of job titles (e.g., replacing "human resource" with synonyms like "HR") and locations for better model generalization.

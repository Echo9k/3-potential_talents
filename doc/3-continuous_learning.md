### Continuous Learning Implementation

Continuous learning refers to the ability of your candidate-ranking system to improve dynamically as it receives more feedback (e.g., starring candidates). This iterative process ensures the model evolves to better align with user preferences over time.

---

### 1. **Objective**
Enable the system to:
1. Incorporate user feedback (starring) as a supervisory signal.
2. Dynamically adjust weights, feature importance, or model parameters based on feedback.
3. Improve future predictions and rankings without requiring full retraining.

---

### 2. **Approaches to Continuous Learning**
There are two main strategies for continuous learning: **Online Learning** and **Re-weighting Approaches**.

---

#### **A. Online Learning**
Online learning updates the model incrementally with each new data point (feedback), rather than retraining on the full dataset.

1. **Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**:
   - Many boosting frameworks support incremental training using `continue_training` or `update` functionality. You can feed the feedback (e.g., starred candidates) as additional training data with adjusted labels (`fit` scores) to fine-tune the model.

   **Steps**:
   - After starring a candidate, treat them as a new data point with a high `fit` score (e.g., 0.95).
   - Retrain the model incrementally on this feedback data.

   ```python
   # Example: Incremental Training with LightGBM
   import lightgbm as lgb

   # Previous model
   booster = lgb.Booster(model_file='model.txt')  # Load pre-trained model

   # New data (feedback)
   feedback_data = pd.DataFrame({
       "job_title": ["starred_candidate_title"],
       "location": ["starred_candidate_location"],
       "connection": [100],
       "fit": [0.95]  # High fit score for starred candidate
   })

   # Process features for feedback data
   # (e.g., generate embeddings, similarity scores, etc.)
   feedback_features = preprocess(feedback_data)

   # Update model incrementally
   booster.update(feedback_features, target=feedback_data["fit"])
   booster.save_model('model_updated.txt')
   ```

   **Pros**:
   - Efficient for large-scale systems.
   - No need to retrain from scratch.

   **Cons**:
   - May require careful tuning to avoid overfitting to a few feedback samples.

---

#### **B. Re-weighting Approaches**
Re-weighting adjusts the importance of features or candidates in the ranking system based on feedback without retraining the model.

1. **Feature Importance Updates**:
   - Adjust feature weights (e.g., `similarity_score`, `TF-IDF_fit_score`) based on feedback.
   - Increase the weight of features that contributed positively to the starred candidate's ranking and reduce those that contributed negatively.

   **Steps**:
   - Identify features that highly correlate with the starred candidate's high rank.
   - Update weights dynamically using a feedback-based multiplier.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Increase weight of 'BERT_model_fit_score' after feedback
   weight_adjustment = {
       "BERT_model_fit_score": 1.2,
       "TF-IDF_fit_score": 0.9
   }
   df["adjusted_fit_score"] = (
       df["BERT_model_fit_score"] * weight_adjustment["BERT_model_fit_score"] +
       df["TF-IDF_fit_score"] * weight_adjustment["TF-IDF_fit_score"]
   )
   df = df.sort_values(by="adjusted_fit_score", ascending=False)
   ```

   **Pros**:
   - Simple and interpretable.
   - Works well when features are stable and well-defined.

   **Cons**:
   - Limited adaptability if feedback is sparse.

2. **Re-ranking Based on Feedback Similarity**:
   - Starred candidates can act as reference points for dynamic re-ranking.
   - Each new feedback entry adjusts the similarity weights in the re-ranking algorithm.

---

### 3. **Incorporating User Feedback**
Capture feedback in real-time and adjust the system accordingly:
1. **Starred Candidate as a Training Signal**:
   - Treat the starred candidate as a new "positive sample" in the dataset with a high `fit` score (e.g., 1.0).
   - Dynamically label unstarred low-ranking candidates with lower scores (e.g., 0.2).

2. **Candidate History Tracking**:
   - Store a history of previously starred candidates and their features.
   - Use this history to refine future predictions by updating the model or similarity metrics.

---

### 4. **Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**
To ensure continuous learning improves system performance:
1. **Monitor Ranking Quality**:
   - Use metrics like **NDCG**, **Precision@k**, or **MRR** to measure ranking effectiveness after feedback incorporation.
2. **Avoid Overfitting**:
   - Use a decay factor for feedback to prevent overfitting to a small set of starred candidates. Older feedback data can have lower weights over time.
   - For example:
     \[
     \text{Adjusted Fit} = \alpha \cdot \text{Current Fit} + \beta \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \cdot \text{Feedback Fit}
     \]
     where \(t\) is the time since feedback was given.

3. **User Validation**:
   - Periodically validate the rankings with users to ensure the updated system aligns with their preferences.

---

### 5. **Implementation Architecture**
Combine continuous learning into the overall system:
1. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Build an interface for users to star candidates and provide optional comments.
2. **Pipeline Integration**:
   - Incorporate feedback handling as a separate pipeline step.
3. **Model Updating**:
   - Use a mix of online learning and re-weighting for incremental updates.

---

### Example Pipeline with Continuous Learning

```python
def process_feedback(starred_candidate, model, data):
    # Step 1: Extract starred candidate features
    starred_features = data.loc[data["id"] == starred_candidate]
    
    # Step 2: Add starred candidate as a new training example
    new_sample = starred_features.copy()
    new_sample["fit"] = 1.0  # Assign high fit score
    feedback_data = pd.concat([data, new_sample])
    
    # Step 3: Update the model (online learning or re-ranking)
    if online_learning_enabled:
        model.update(feedback_data)  # Incremental model update
    else:
        adjust_weights(feedback_data)  # Re-weighting
    
    # Step 4: Re-rank candidates
    re_ranked_data = re_rank(data, starred_features)
    
    return re_ranked_data
```

### Key Considerations
1. **Scalability**:
   - Ensure the model and re-ranking algorithms are efficient enough to handle large datasets and frequent feedback updates.
2. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - Monitor for feedback loops that may reinforce existing biases.
3. **Transparency**:
   - Provide explanations for re-ranked lists, particularly when feedback significantly alters rankings.

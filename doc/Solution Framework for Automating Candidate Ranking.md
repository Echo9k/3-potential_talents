### Solution Framework for Automating Candidate Ranking

To address the challenges and goals, I propose the following framework, which combines machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and supervised ranking methodologies to rank and re-rank candidates dynamically.

------

### **1. Candidate Fitness Prediction**

#### **Approach:**

- Use a 

  machine learning model

   trained on historical hiring data to predict the fitness of a candidate based on their attributes. This includes:

  - Feature Engineering:

    - Extract keywords from `job_title` using NLP techniques (TF-IDF, embeddings).

    - Encode 

      ```
      location
      ```

       and 

      ```
      connections
      ```

      :

      - Geographical proximity to job location (if available).
      - Normalize connection values (e.g., "500+" -> 500, others to numeric values).

    - Incorporate user-provided keywords as matching features (e.g., cosine similarity of keywords and `job_title` embeddings).

  - Model Selection:

    - Gradient Boosted Trees (e.g., XGBoost) or neural networks for tabular data.
    - A regression or ranking objective to predict the `fitness` score.

  - Train using supervised learning with a dataset labeled with fitness scores from manual reviews.

#### **Output:**

- A fitness score for each candidate.

#### **Success Metrics:**

- Evaluate using NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) to measure ranking quality.
- Monitor recall/precision of highly ranked candidates.

### **2. Candidate Ranking and Re-Ranking with Starring**

#### **Approach:**

1. Initial Ranking:

   - Use the fitness scores to rank candidates.

2. Re-Ranking Based on Supervisory Signal:

   - Use starred candidates as additional input for a 

     Learning-to-Rank (LTR)

      algorithm.

     - Example: Pairwise or Listwise approaches (e.g., LambdaMART, RankNet).

   - Incorporate starred candidates into the training data dynamically:

     - Add positive/negative pairs: Starred candidates as "better" than others.
     - Update feature importance based on starred examples.

   - Re-train or fine-tune the model incrementally after each starring action.

#### **Output:**

- A dynamic ranking list updated in real-time after each starring action.

------

### **3. Candidate Filtering**

#### **Approach:**

- Use a 

  preprocessing filter

   to exclude irrelevant candidates before ranking:

  - Text Matching:
    - Use fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance, cosine similarity) to ensure `job_title` aligns closely with keywords.
    - Eliminate candidates with low semantic similarity.
  - Location Matching:
    - Set geographical cutoffs if location proximity is essential.
  - Connections:
    - Eliminate candidates with extremely low connections (e.g., <50 if a minimum threshold applies).

#### **Output:**

- A cleaned list of candidates.

#### **Success Metrics:**

- Filter efficiency (percentage of irrelevant candidates removed).
- False positive rate (relevant candidates mistakenly excluded).

------

### **4. Determining a Cut-Off Point for Other Roles**

#### **Approach:**

- Use historical hiring patterns to determine thresholds:
  - Analyze the average fitness score of successful candidates for a role.
  - Use this as a baseline to create cut-offs, dynamically adjustable by user input.
- Incorporate a confidence interval to capture high-potential candidates slightly below the threshold.

#### **Output:**

- Role-specific cut-off scores for ranking.

#### **Success Metrics:**

- Evaluate missed potential hires (false negatives).
- Assess efficiency in reducing manual reviews.

------

### **5. Bias Mitigation**

#### **Approach:**

- Model Interpretability:
  - Use SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to explain the modelâ€™s ranking decisions.
  - Highlight feature contributions for transparency.
- Debiasing Techniques:
  - Ensure demographic diversity in training data.
  - Penalize over-reliance on biased features (e.g., location).
- Human-in-the-Loop Automation:
  - Incorporate user feedback loops:
    - Use "starring" to reduce bias by surfacing diverse candidates manually overlooked.

#### **Output:**

- Bias-adjusted candidate rankings.

#### **Success Metrics:**

- Increased diversity in the top 10 candidates.
- Reduced disparity in ranking scores for diverse candidates.

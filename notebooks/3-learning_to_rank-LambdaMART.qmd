## Candidate Ranking and Re-Ranking with Starring

This section highlights the steps taken to evaluate candidate ranking performance effectively.

---

### 1. **Dependencies**

The following libraries are required for implementing the ranking workflow:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

```Markdown
**Key Highlights**:

- `xgboost` is a robust and scalable gradient boosting library, ideal for implementing Learning-to-Rank models.
- `pandas` enables efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- `IPython.display` supports dynamic visualization in notebooks.

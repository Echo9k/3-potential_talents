Rank the candidates based on their resumes and profiles, prioritizing alignment with the key responsibilities and qualifications outlined in the job description. Consider both the relevance of their experience and skills to the job requirements (job description similarity) and their proximity to the job location.

Specifically:

1.  **Job Description Similarity:** Evaluate how well each candidate's experience and skills, as detailed in their resume/profile, match the core requirements and responsibilities of the job description. Prioritize candidates whose experience directly addresses the key responsibilities and required skills.
2.  **Location Proximity:** Factor in the candidate's proximity to the job location. Closer proximity is generally preferred, but explicitly state if remote work is an option.
3.  **Overall Ranking:** Combine the job description similarity and location proximity to create an overall ranking. Candidates with strong matches to the job description and closer proximity should rank higher.

Present the top 5 candidates in a Markdown table with the following columns:

*   **Rank:** Numerical ranking (1-5).
*   **Candidate Name:** Candidate's full name.
*   **Job Description Match (Qualitative):** A brief qualitative assessment of how well the candidate's experience aligns with the job description (e.g., "Excellent match - extensive experience in key areas," "Good match - some relevant experience," "Fair match - limited relevant experience").
*   **Location:** Candidate's location and its proximity to the job location (e.g., "Located in [City, State] - close proximity," "Located in [City, State] - remote work possible," "Located in [City, State] - distant").

Do not include any intermediary steps, calculations, or reasoning. Only provide the final Markdown table.
